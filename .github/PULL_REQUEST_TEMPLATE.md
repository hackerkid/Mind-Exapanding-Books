## Adding new book
* The book I am adding is "| Alex Rider:Eagle Strike | Anthony Horowitz | [4.12](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175004.Eagle_Strike?ac=1&from_search=true) | 2003 |".
* I am adding this book to Fiction section.
* I have read this book 4+ times.
* I think this book deserves to be in this list because it is about a teenage spy working for the MI6, the British International intelligence.It is an all time thriller and it always makes a person glued to it since it has a lot of action every page and you wish for it to never stop.
