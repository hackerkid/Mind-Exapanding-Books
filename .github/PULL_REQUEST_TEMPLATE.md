## Adding new book

- The book I am adding is "Animal Farm" by George Orwell
- I am adding this book to Classics section.
- I have read this book several times.
- I think this book deserves to be in this list because it serves as both social critique and a warning. It is an allegory of the Russian communist revolution.
